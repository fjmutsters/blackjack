    "Most important rules:  \n",
    "- The goal of blackjack is to beat the Dealer's hand without going over 21\n",
    "- Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 11 (**or 1, need to code!**), whichever makes a better hand\n",
    "- Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end\n",
    "- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn\n",
    "- If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand\n",
    "- **If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack (need to code!)\n",
    "- Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher\n",
    "- First (player or dealer) to win 3 rounds wins game!"
