    "## Rules \n",
    "- The goal of blackjack is to beat the Dealer's hand without going over 21\n",
    "- Cards are worth rank on card, except for face cards that are worth 10. Aces are worth 11 or 1, whichever makes a better hand\n",
    "- The player starts with two cards and has first turn\n",
    "- One of the dealer's cards is hidden until the dealer is playing\n",
    "- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn\n",
    "- If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand\n",
    "- If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a BlackJack\n",
    "- Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher\n",
    "- First (player or dealer) to win # number rounds (player determines number of rounds) wins game!"
