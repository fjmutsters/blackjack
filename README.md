## Project Description
In this project I developed a game of BlackJack (Twenty-One) that interacts with the user. I like playing card games, so I decided to start with a relative simpler game such as BlackJack instead of poker.

## Rules
- The goal of blackjack is to beat the Dealer's hand without going over 21  
- Cards are worth rank on card, except for face cards that are worth 10. Aces are worth 11 or 1, whichever makes a better hand  
- The player starts with two cards and has first turn  
- One of the dealer's cards is hidden until the dealer is playing  
- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn  
- If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand  
- If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a BlackJack  
- Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher  
- First (player or dealer) to win # number rounds (player determines number of rounds) wins game!

## Organization
